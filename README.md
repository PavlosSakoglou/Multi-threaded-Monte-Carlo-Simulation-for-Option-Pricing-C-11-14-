# Multi-threaded Monte Carlo Simulation App for Option Pricing in C++11/14

# Description 

Overview of the Multi-threaded Monte Carlo Simulation Console App for approximating the prices of financial derivatives (options) via Finite-Difference Methods, the Euler and Milstein Approximations, built using RAT domain architecture and the builder design pattern in C++11/C++14

# Usage

Download the .exe file in your computer and then run it. Use a virtual machine in case you operate in Mac OS, or Wine for other operating systems than Windows: https://www.winehq.org/

Since the code is for demonstration only, there are missing components of the application, thus you cannot compile the provided files in this repository, except the plain Monte Carlo file.
